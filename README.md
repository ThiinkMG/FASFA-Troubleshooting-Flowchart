```css
--mcf-primary-color: #012699;    /* Brand blue */
--mcf-secondary-color: #26e011;  /* Brand green */
--mcf-accent-color: #fdc003;     /* Brand amber */
```

--touch-target-recommended: 48px; /* Material Design */
```

### Typography Scale
- Base font: 16px mobile ‚Üí 18px desktop
- Fluid scaling using `clamp()` for headings
- Line heights: 1.2 (tight), 1.5 (normal), 1.7 (relaxed)

## üìä Flowchart Data Structure

The flowchart follows a decision tree structure with state management:

```javascript
flowchartState = {
  currentStep: string,      // Current active step ID
  history: array,           // Navigation history
  userAnswers: object       // User selections { step: 'yes'|'no' }
}

flowMap = {
  'personal-yes': 'personal-action',
  'personal-no': 'financial',
  // ... decision paths
}
```

## üîß Development

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Make changes to the code
4. Refresh the browser to see changes (page auto-reloads after print)

### Adding New Troubleshooting Steps
To add new flowchart steps:
1. Add a new `.flowchart-step` div in the HTML
2. Update the `flowMap` object with decision paths
3. Add question data to `questionData` object for results display
4. The application will automatically include the new step

### Modifying Readiness Score Logic
The readiness score calculation is in `updateReadinessScore()`:
- "No" answers = No problems = Higher score (18-25 points)
- "Yes" answers = Has problems = Lower score (8-12 points)
- Weighted scoring by category importance
